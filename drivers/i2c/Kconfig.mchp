	  This enables INTERRUPT driven transactions for the I2C peripheral.

	  This enables DMA driven transactions for the I2C peripheral.
	  DMA driven mode requires fewer interrupts to handle the
	  transaction and ensures that high speed modes are not delayed
	  by data reloading.

	  Timeout in milliseconds used for each I2C transfer.
	  0 means that the driver should use the K_FOREVER value,
	  i.e. it should wait as long as necessary.
