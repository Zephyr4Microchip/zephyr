	bool "Provide unaligned write support"
	help
	  Enable this option to allow the Zephyr flash API to write data to flash
	  memory at offsets that are not aligned to the device's write block size
	  When enabled, the driver will handle unaligned writes internally, typically
	  using read-modify-write operations to ensure data integrity. This allows
	  applications to write data starting at any offset within the flash memory
	  space, not just at aligned addresses.
