  Group of GPIO-controlled LEDs.

  Each LED is defined in a child node of the gpio-leds node.

  Here is an example which defines three LEDs in the node /leds:

  / {
    leds {
      compatible = "gpio-leds";
      led_0 {
        gpios = <&gpio0 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
      };
      led_1 {
        gpios = <&gpio0 2 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
      };
      led_2 {
        gpios = <&gpio1 15 (GPIO_PULL_UP | GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW)>;
      };
    };
  };

  Above:

  - led_0 is pin 1 on gpio0. The LED is on when the pin is low,
    and off when the pin is high.
  - led_1 is pin 2 on gpio0. The LED is on when the pin is high,
    and off when it is low.
  - led_2 is pin 15 on gpio1. The LED is on when the pin is low,
    and the pin's internal pull-up resistor should be enabled.
