properties:
  reg:
    required: true
    description: Register base address and size for the RTC peripheral.

  clocks:
    required: true
    description: Clock phandles used to drive the RTC.

  clock-names:
    required: true
    description: Clock name corresponding to the `clocks` entry.

  interrupts:

    description: Interrupt specifier for the RTC peripheral.

  prescaler:
    type: int
    enum:
      - 1
      - 2
      - 4
      - 8
      - 16

    description: |
      RTC frequency equals clock-frequency divided by the prescaler value

  alarms-count:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Number of alarms supported by RTC device. The number of
      alarms defaults to 0, which indicates that the RTC has
      no alarms.

  cal-constant:
    type: int
    description: |
      Define the constant used to calculate the calibration. More
      information can be found in the datasheet of each SoC series
      at RTC Frequency Correction topic.

# Example:
# Correction in ppm = (FREQCORR.VALUE * 1e6 ppm) / (8192 * 128)
#
# &rtc {
#     cal-constant = <1048576>; /* 8192 * 128 */
# };
