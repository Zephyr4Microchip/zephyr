# Description of the Microchip PWM TC driver
description: >
  Microchip PWM TC  driver. This driver is responsible for configuring
  and managing the TC peripheral in Microchip microcontrollers for PWM configuration.

# Compatible string to match this device with the corresponding driver
compatible: "microchip,pwm-tc-u2249"

# Include base properties from the common TC binding file
include:
  - pwm-controller.yaml
  - microchip,tc-u2249.yaml

properties:
  channels:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: >
      This specifies the maximum number of channels available for the peripheral.

  max_bit_width:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: >
      Maximum bit width supported by the PWM counter. This property indicates the
      resolution of the counter, which can be 8, 16, 24, or 32 bits.
    enum:
      - 8
      - 16
      - 32

# Example usage in a Device Tree Source (DTS) file:
#
#   pwm_led0: pwm_led_0 {
#       status = "okay";
#       pwms = <&tcc0 2 PWM_MSEC(20) 0>;
#   };
#
# Explanation:
#   - 'pwm_led0' is a node representing a device (e.g., an LED) controlled by PWM.
#   - The 'pwms' property uses the phandle to the PWM controller (here, 'tcc0'),
#     specifies channel 2, sets the PWM period to 20 milliseconds,
#     and uses a polarity of 0 (normal).
#   - The order of the 'pwms' arguments matches the 'pwm-cells' definition:
#       <&controller channel period polarity>
#   - This allows the device to be driven with a specific PWM configuration using
#     the Microchip PWM TC driver.

  - channel
  - period
  - polarity
