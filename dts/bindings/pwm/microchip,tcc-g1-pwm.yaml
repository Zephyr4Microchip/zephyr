  Microchip TCC pwm driver.

  This driver is used for configuring
  and managing TCC (Timer/ Counter for Control Applications)
  peripheral in Microchip microcontrollers. This peripherals
  support creating PWM signals. The supported peripherals are
  as follows:
    - tcc-u2213

compatible: "microchip,tcc-g1-pwm"

include:
  - base.yaml
  - pwm-controller.yaml
  - microchip,tcc-g1.yaml
  - pinctrl-device.yaml

pwm-cells:
  - channel
  - period
  - polarity

properties:
  max-bit-width:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: >
      Maximum bit width supported by the counter.

      This property indicates the resolution of the counter.
    enum:
      - 16
      - 24
