# Description of the Microchip TC, RTC, and TCC counter driver
description: >
  Microchip TCC pwm driver. This driver is used for configuring
  and managing TCC (Timer/ Counter for Control Applications)
  peripheral in Microchip microcontrollers. This peripherals
  support creating PWM signals.

# Compatible strings for the device
compatible: "microchip,pwm-tcc-u2213"

# Include base properties from the common TCC binding file

include:
  - base.yaml
  - pwm-controller.yaml
  - microchip,tcc-u2213.yaml
  - pinctrl-device.yaml

pwm-cells:
  - channel
  - period
  - polarity

properties:
  # Maximum bit width supported by the counter
  max_bit_width:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: >
      Maximum bit width supported by the counter. This property indicates the
      resolution of the counter, which can be 8, 16, 24, or 32 bits.
    enum:
