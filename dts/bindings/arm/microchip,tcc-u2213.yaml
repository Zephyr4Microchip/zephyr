properties:
  reg:
    description: >
      Specifies the base address and size of the register set for the timer counter peripheral.
    required: true

  interrupts:
    description: >
      Defines the interrupt lines used by the timer counter peripheral. This property
      specifies the interrupt number and priority.
    required: true

  clocks:
    description: >
      Specifies the clock sources and their configurations for the timer counter peripheral.
      This property ensures the peripheral is provided with the necessary clock signals.
    required: true

  prescaler:
    type: int
    description: >
      Timer prescaler values. The prescaler divides the input clock frequency to
      achieve the desired timer frequency. Common prescaler values include 1, 2,
      4, 8, 16, 64, 256, and 1024.
    enum:
      - 1
      - 2
      - 4
      - 8

      - 1024

  instance-id:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: >
      Unique identifier indicating the sequence or instance number of the peripheral.
      This is primarily used for scenarios like chaining peripherals (e.g., for 32-bit
      PWM or counter operation). The value determines the peripheral's position in
      the chaining hierarchy.
