  Microchip TC g1 peripherals are used for creating the PWM output on different channels
  as well as used as a timer/counter.
  This yaml supports the following peripherals
    - tc-u2249

compatible: "microchip,tc-g1"

include:
  - name: base.yaml
  - name: pinctrl-device.yaml

properties:
  reg:
    description: |
      Specifies the base address and size of the register set for the timer counter peripheral.
    required: true

  interrupts:
    description: |
      Defines the interrupt lines used by the timer counter peripheral.

      This property specifies the interrupt number and priority.
    required: true

  clocks:
    description: |
      Specifies the clock sources and their configurations for the timer counter peripheral.

      This property ensures the peripheral is provided with the necessary clock signals.
      The following are the clock names applicable to this property.
       - mclk
       - gclk
       - client_mclk : This is the clock subsystem of the client with
         which the instance can be paired. This is an optional clock name.
         It is only applicable to those peripherals which can be paired with another
         instance for achieving a higher max bit width. In this particular case, 32-bit max-bit-width
         is attained by pairing two such instances. The ability for an instance to pair with another instance
         attain higher max-bit-width will be specified in their respective datasheets.
         It is not available for all the instances.
    required: true

  prescaler:
    type: int
    description: |
      Timer prescaler values.

      The prescaler divides the input clock frequency to
      achieve the desired timer frequency.
    enum:
      - 1
      - 2
      - 4
      - 8
      - 16
      - 64
      - 256
      - 1024

  channels:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      This property indicates the maximum available channels in a peripheral instance
