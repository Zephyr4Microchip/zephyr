  Microchip TC g1 peripherals are used for creating the PWM output on different channels
  as well as used as a timer/counter.
  This yaml supports the following peripherals
    - tc-u2249

compatible: "microchip,tc-g1"

# Include common properties from base.yaml and pinctrl-device.yaml
include:
  - name: base.yaml
  - name: pinctrl-device.yaml

properties:
  reg:
    description: |
      Specifies the base address and size of the register set for the timer counter peripheral.
    required: true

  interrupts:
    description: |
      Defines the interrupt lines used by the timer counter peripheral. This property
      specifies the interrupt number and priority.
    required: true

  clocks:
    description: |
      Specifies the clock sources and their configurations for the timer counter peripheral.
      This property ensures the peripheral is provided with the necessary clock signals.
      The following are the clock names applicable to this property.
       - mclk
       - gclk
       - client_mclk : This is the clock subsystem of the client with
         which the instance can be paired
    required: true

  prescaler:
    type: int
    description: |
      Timer prescaler values. The prescaler divides the input clock frequency to
      achieve the desired timer frequency. Common prescaler values include 1, 2,
      4, 8, 16, 64, 256, and 1024.
    enum:
      - 1
      - 2
      - 4
      - 8
      - 16
      - 64
      - 256
      - 1024
