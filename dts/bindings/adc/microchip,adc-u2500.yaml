  prescaler, vref-mv, clocks and interrupts.

compatible: "microchip,adc-u2500"

include:
  - name: adc-controller.yaml
  - name: pinctrl-device.yaml

properties:
  reg:
    required: true
    description: Register base address and size for the ADC peripheral.

  interrupts:
    required: true
    description: Interrupt specifier for the ADC peripheral.

  clocks:
    required: true
    description: Clock phandles used to drive the ADC.

  clock-names:
    required: true
    description: Clock name corresponding to the `clocks` entry.

  vref-mv:
    type: int
    description: |
      ADC reference voltage in millivolts.
      This should match the reference selected in hardware or software config.

  prescaler:
    type: int
    required: true
    enum: [2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256]
    description: |
      Clock prescaler value. Must be a power of 2 between 2 and 256 inclusive.
      The ADC clock is derived by dividing the source clock by this prescaler.

  num-channels:
    type: int
    required: true
    default: 23
    description: |
      Number of ADC input channels supported by the hardware instance.

  "#io-channel-cells":
    const: 1
    description: Specifies that each io-channel uses a single cell (input index).

  calib-offset:
    type: int
    enum: [0, 14]
    description: |
      Bit offset of the BIASCOMP field in NVM software calibration region.
      Typically 0 for ADC0 and 14 for ADC1. Used on SAMD5x/E5x SoCs.
